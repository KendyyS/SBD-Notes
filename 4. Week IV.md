### 🗓️ Week 4: Aggregate Functions

#### 📍 Purpose of Aggregate Functions
- Used to perform calculations on a group of rows, returning a single reslut.
- Operate on sets of rows as described by the query and oare often used in conjunction with the **GROUP BY** clause to group rows that have the same _values_ in specified columns.
- Often used to **summarize** and **analyze** data.

#### 📍 Kind of Aggregate Function
- avg : average value :\
  select avg(salary)\
  from instructor\
  where dept_name = 'Comp.Sci.';
- count : number of values :\
  select count(distinct ID) (distinct = unique value / no duplicate)\
  from teaches\
  where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2018;
- min : minimum value :\
  select min(salary)\
  from instructor\
  where salary > 1000;
- max : maximum value :\
  select max(salary)\
  from instructor\
- sum : sum of values\
  select sum(salary)
  from instructor\
  
#### 📍 Having Clause
HAVING filters out the groups based on certain criteria or conditions.\
Ex : Find the names and average salaries of all departments whose average salary is greater than 65000.\
select dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary\
from instructor\
group by dept_name\
having avg(salary) > 65000;\
Notes : predicates in the having clause are applied after the formation of groups whereas predicates in the where clause are applied before forming groups.

#### 📍 Set Membership
- Find courses offerd in Fall 2017 and in Spring 2018\
  select distinct course_id\
  from section\
  where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2017\
  and course_id in (select course_id\
  from section\
  where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2018);
- Find courses offered in Fall 2017 but not in Spring 2018\
  select distinct course_id\
  from section\
  where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2017 and\
  course id not in (select course_id\
  from section\
  where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2018);
